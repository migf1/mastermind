Mastermind
==========

A CLI implementation of the well-known Mastermind game.
It is written in C99 and is supposed to be platform independent.

Game rules
-----------
At the beginning of the game computer chooses a secret code consisting of
4 unique colors in random order. Your goal is to find this code and to do so
you have a specified number of tries. For each try computer gives you some
information. For each color that exists in your code in exact the same position
as in computer's secret code a red mark will be sown and for each color in your
code that appears in secret code too but not in the correct position, a yellow
mark will be sown. If you find the secret code before the game is over, you win.

Requirements
------------
You only need a C compiler and the Make tool.

Installation
-------------
Just type make to compile the program.

You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source code
directory by typing `make clean'.
